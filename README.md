# Uptask - Task Manager.

Web application created in order to manage projects in which you are working or will work. The development of the application was carried out with different technologies such as HTML 5, CSS 3, JS, AJAX, PHP and MySQL. The application has a login system, in which when entering it allows us to manage our projects, being able to create, read, update and delete data in a database, thus keeping an efficient record of our projects.

A simple and interactive design with which they could be cooked for future projects, the intention is to give an idea of how they could do it and save time.

The website is not responsive, as explained above is just to give an idea.
